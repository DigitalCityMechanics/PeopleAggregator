Enclosed are assets needed for City Network Theme.

All paths are set with the assumption the theme directory resides at   Themes/Default/skins/City/


This theme uses the page ID names in the body tag in the 5 pages below. Complete body ID tag usage is listed at:
http://wiki.broadbandmechanics.com/index.php/Pages  (Important Note: as noted in the wiki comments, the ID for the people page breaks he naming convention. The ID is pg_people while the php page is called peoples.php.)

All css for the Theme is in a style sheet placed after the network_skin.css called
city_skin.css. I developed the theme while linking to the existing layout.css and network_skin.css on peepagg.net. Probably no
reason to change them.

The css file and images directory should reside together in a directory below Themes called City.


I have supplied the config.xml file although I do not understand the usage of the homePageLink and link tags.

The city_skin.css will serve as a default setings reference.
