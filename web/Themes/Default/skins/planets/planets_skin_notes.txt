Enclosed are assets needed for Planets Network Theme.

All paths are set with the assumption the theme directory resides at
Themes/Default/skins/Planets/

This theme uses the page ID names in the body tag in the 5 pages
below. Complete body ID tag usage is listed at:

    http://wiki.broadbandmechanics.com/index.php/Pages

(Important Note: as noted in the wiki comments, the ID for the people
page breaks he naming convention. The ID is pg_people while the php
page is called peoples.php.)


The theme alos uses the div <div id="foreground_element"></div> just
before the close body tag in the 5 pages listed below.

All css for the Theme is in a style sheet placed after the
network_skin.css called planets_skin.css. I developed the theme while
linking to the existing layout.css and network_skin.css on
peepagg.net. Probably no reason to change them.

The css file and images directory should reside together in a
directory below Themes/Default/skins/ called Planets.

The supplied iepngfix.htc file needs to be moved up two levels to the
same level as the php pages.

The image directory at the same top level needs to contain the
supplied blank.gif file.


I have supplied a settings file to define what controls are available
to users for customization of theme. A couple settings items are
noted. At this time I do not have a sense of how this document will be
formatted for final deployment.

The planets_skin.css will serve as a default setings reference.
