Enclosed are assets needed for Street User Theme.

All paths are set with the assumption the theme directory resides at   Themes/Default/skins/Street/


This theme DOES NOT use the page ID names in the body tag. The theme has been tested on user.php and user_blog.php in Firefox 1.5 and IE6.


THEME DEMO:

All css for the Theme is in a style sheet placed after the network_skin.css called
street_skin.css. I developed the theme while linking to the existing layout.css and network_skin.css on peepagg.net. Probably no
reason to change them.

The css file and images directory should reside together in a directory below Themes called Street.
I have supplied the config.xml file although I do not understand the usage of the homePageLink and link tags.

The street_skin.css will serve as a default setings reference.
