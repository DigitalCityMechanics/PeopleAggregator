Enclosed are assets needed for Soccer User Theme.

All paths are set with the assumption the theme directory resides at   Themes/Default/skins/Soccer/


This theme DOES NOT use the page ID names in the body tag. The theme has been tested on user.php and user_blog.php in Firefox 1.5 and IE6.

Note that this theme has a taller desktop image space by 50 pixels. It turns out that, if inserted, the desktop image stretches to 200 pixels tall. The default in this theme is no desktop image.

All css for the Theme is in a style sheet placed after the network_skin.css called
soccer_skin.css. I developed the theme while linking to the existing layout.css and network_skin.css on peepagg.net. Probably no
reason to change them.

The css file and images directory should reside together in a directory below Themes called City.
I have supplied the config.xml file although I do not understand the usage of the homePageLink and link tags.

The soccer_skin.css will serve as a default setings reference.
