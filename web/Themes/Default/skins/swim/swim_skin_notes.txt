Enclosed are assets needed for Swim Network Theme.

All paths are set with the assumption the theme directory resides at   Themes/Default/skins/Swim/


This theme uses the page ID names in the body tag in the 5 pages below. Complete body ID tag usage is listed at:
http://wiki.broadbandmechanics.com/index.php/Pages  (Important Note: as noted in the wiki comments, the ID for the people page breaks he naming convention. The ID is pg_people while the php page is called peoples.php.)


The theme alos uses the div <div id="foreground_element"></div> just before the close body tag in the 5 pages listed below.

All css for the Theme is in a style sheet placed after the network_skin.css called
swim_skin.css. I developed the theme while linking to the existing layout.css and network_skin.css on peepagg.net. Probably no
reason to change them.

The css file and images directory should reside together in a directory below Themes called Swim.

The supplied iepngfix.htc file needs to be moved up two levels to the same level as the php pages. 

The image directory at the same top level needs to contain the supplied blank.gif file.

Also, although I have supplied a settings file to define what controls are available to users for customization
of theme, I do not have  a sense of how this document will be formatted.

The swim_skin.css will serve as a default setings reference.
