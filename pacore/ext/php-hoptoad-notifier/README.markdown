# Introduction

This is a simple [Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com) notifier for PHP. It's been used in a few production sites now with success. It's not quite as fully featured as the official Ruby notifier but it works well.

# Thanks

Big thanks to Lou Kosak, Till Klampaeckel and Scott Woods who have contributed extensively to this project.

# Limitations

This notifier does not contain two big features from the Ruby notifier. The two are error filtering and deploy tracking. Error filtering will be coming in a future release.

For deploy tracking, since I use Capistrano to deploy my PHP apps, I simply use the Ruby notifier to perform the deploy tracking. For this reason, unless someone wants to contribute patches, I don't see deploy tracking coming to the php notifier.

# Requirements

To use the default _pear_ client install Pear's HTTP_Request2:

    pear install HTTP_Request2

To use the _curl_ client, install the PHP curl extension. To install on Ubuntu if you are using PHP 5 you would run:
		sudo apt-get install php5-curl
		sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
